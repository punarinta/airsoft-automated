    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
        The idea of this service is to automate as much in airsoft as possible, helping both those who play and those who arrange games.
        I hope this will stimulate at least a bit of people to organize more games in the area they live.
        I've started with some basic things here, so don't expect too much right now. But the development is ongoing all the time, so more features are coming. And I'm always open for your proposals.

<!--    <h3>Payment providers</h3>
    <p>
        To process payments safely all this job is delegated to so called payment providers. They treat users' data with care and also prevent fraud.
        They charge for it, so even if I'm not charging anything personally (due to a possible agreement with you) payment provider will still take some, usually that's around 3%.
