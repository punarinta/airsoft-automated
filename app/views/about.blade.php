    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
        I'm playing airsoft for 10 years and programming for 15 years. I'm bad at design, but not so bad at software development.
        The idea of this service is to automate as much in airsoft as possible, helping both those who play and those who arrange games.
        I've started with some basic things, so don't expect too much right now. But the development is ongoing all the time and I'm always opened for your proposals.

        Yes, cookies are used here. I have to inform you about it according to the law. The only purpose for them to be used is to know if you are logged in or not.

    <h3>Liability disclaimer</h3>
    <p>
        I'm not responsible for any losses you had due to the usage of this system. I will try to help you if possible in case you had them, but I bear no legal responsibility. That's so simple.

    <h3>Payment providers</h3>
    <p>
        To process payments safely I delegate all this job so called payment providers. They treat users' data with care and also prevent fraud.
        They charge for it, so even if I'm not charging anything personally (due to a possible agreement with you) payment provider will still take some, usually that's around 3%.
